# ADR 0009 — User model is provider-independent

**Status:** Accepted

## Decision

Durable interests, preferences, and feedback live in Kuşluk's own canonical local model, not inside one AI vendor's memory system.

External AI subscriptions or memories may contribute candidate signals, but they are optional connectors.

## Rationale

The publication must survive provider churn and preserve accumulated preference state.

## Consequences

No model provider is the system of record for the user's long-term Kuşluk profile.
