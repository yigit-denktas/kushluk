# Failure Matrix

Kuşluk must fail visibly and usefully.

## Severity

### INFO
A non-essential source is unavailable and the edition remains materially complete.

Action: local log; optional small editorial omission.

### DEGRADED
A meaningful source or feature is unavailable, but a useful edition can still be produced.

Action: continue, reflow content, record degradation, notify when the missing source affects user expectations.

### FAILED
The core edition or requested delivery cannot complete.

Action: preserve generated artefacts, notify explicitly, attempt configured fallback where safe.

## Initial failure catalogue

## Error message style

Messages must state:
1. what failed;
2. what Kuşluk did instead;
3. whether the edition is still usable;
4. what the user can do, if action is required.

Bad:
> Something went wrong.

Good:
> Calendar sync failed, so today's edition was generated without calendar events. Printing continued. Reconnect the calendar connector before the next edition.
