# Editorial System

## Purpose

Kuşluk is not a feed aggregator. Its editorial system exists to **select, compress, connect, and omit**.

Core rule:

> **Selection over collection. Reliability before cleverness.**

## Edition geometry

Default:
- one DIN A4 sheet;
- front: **Today**;
- back: **For You**;
- approximately 10–15 minutes of reading;
- QR/link escape hatches for depth.

The editorial system cuts content to fit the artifact. The artifact does not expand indefinitely to fit the feed.

## Lead story

A lead is optional.

Use one only when a candidate clearly deserves disproportionate attention. Do not manufacture hierarchy for visual drama.

On quieter days, use a balanced composition.

## Practical priority

On the printed page:

1. calendar / fixed commitments;
2. tasks / user-selected priorities;
3. relevant weather/context;
4. stable travel reminders;
5. editorial stories and personal columns.

### Why calendar/tasks outrank travel details

Calendar and task commitments are relatively stable during the morning. Travel operations are volatile and live apps such as rail/airline tools provide fresher operational updates.

Therefore Kuşluk should print the stable part of travel:
- departure reminder;
- trip identity;
- station/airport;
- planned time;
- a prompt or QR to the live source.

It should not pretend that a static page is the best authority for delays, platform changes, gate changes, or cancellations.

## Candidate pool

Possible sources include:
- calendar and tasks;
- weather;
- RSS bundles;
- newsletters;
- X;
- Reddit;
- Hacker News;
- public web/news search;
- email-derived signals;
- user-selected feeds;
- external AI daily briefings as non-authoritative candidate generators.

The pool should be deliberately larger than the printed edition.

## Normalisation

Every candidate should be normalised into a provider-independent schema containing at least:
- candidate ID;
- source;
- source URL/reference;
- publication/retrieval time;
- title;
- canonical topic/story cluster;
- short factual summary;
- source quality / confidence;
- personal relevance reasons;
- timeliness;
- novelty;
- estimated reading cost;
- verification state.

## Deduplication and story clustering

Multiple sources covering the same underlying event should become one editorial story cluster.

Do not reward repetition as importance by default.

Repeated independent coverage may increase confidence or global-materiality signals, but should not consume multiple print slots.

## Ranking dimensions

Initial ranking should be explicit and inspectable.

Dimensions may include:
- relevance to today;
- personal relevance;
- global/material importance;
- freshness;
- source quality;
- novelty;
- continuity with an ongoing story;
- learning value;
- estimated reading effort;
- diversity / serendipity.

Do not bury the ranking logic entirely inside an opaque LLM prompt.

## Beats

Beats are user-selected, not permanent mandatory boxes.

A user may declare interests such as:
- AI;
- architecture;
- geospatial;
- culture;
- finance;
- local city topics;
- science;
- other natural-language interests.

If nothing material happened in a beat, omit it.

Later versions may propose emerging beats based on user behaviour, but must not silently mutate the profile.

## Serendipity

Protect at least one editorial opportunity for something outside the established profile when it is:
- globally important;
- unusually interesting;
- intellectually useful;
- culturally meaningful;
- locally relevant.

Serendipity must not become random filler.

## Tone

**Factual core, conversational wrapper.**

Facts should remain crisp and attributable.

Headlines, transitions, callbacks, and short editorial notes may be conversational, witty, or personal when appropriate.

Do not distort uncertainty or factual precision for personality.

## Language policy

Language is editorially flexible.

Possible modes:
- single-language edition;
- language by section;
- intentional code-switching;
- language-learning micro-sections.

Mixing must have a reason: comprehension, voice, learning, quotation, or context.

## Continuity and archive references

Stories may refer to prior editions.

Example:
> We first covered this in 2026-07-11 · Edition 042.

Digital editions should make such references clickable.

Print editions may use a compact edition/story reference plus QR code.

## Cut policy

When the edition does not fit, cut in this order:

1. exact duplicates;
2. low-value filler;
3. redundant context already stated elsewhere;
4. secondary detail that can move behind a QR/link;
5. lower-ranked optional stories;
6. optional personal columns.

Only then consider modest copy tightening.

Never solve overflow primarily by making text uncomfortably small.

## Failure-aware editing

Unavailable data should not create an empty card/column.

Instead:
- remove the block and reflow;
- substitute a configured fallback;
- display a compact unavailability note when the missing data materially changes the promise.

## Source integrity

An AI-generated briefing or summary is a lead, not evidence.

Material factual claims should be grounded in original or reputable sources whenever practical.
