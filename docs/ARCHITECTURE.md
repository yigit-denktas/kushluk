# Architecture

## Architectural intent

Kuşluk separates **personal context**, **research/editorial intelligence**, and **publication/printing** so that privacy, reliability, and provider independence survive changes in vendors.

## High-level pipeline

```text
Connectors
  -> Personal Data Plane
  -> Candidate Normalisation
  -> Research / Verification
  -> Editorial Engine
  -> Publication Model
  -> Deterministic Renderer
  -> Layout Validator
  -> Print / Digital Delivery
  -> Edition Archive
```

## Personal data plane

The personal data plane is the user's durable state.

It may run:
- on a local computer;
- on a home server;
- on a user-controlled VPS/cloud account.

It stores or mediates:
- preferences;
- configured home/default location;
- calendars/tasks;
- source configuration;
- user-interest model;
- edition history;
- secrets/connector tokens through an appropriate secrets mechanism;
- local feedback signals.

By default, this state does not live on Kuşluk-operated infrastructure.

## Public research plane

Public news, weather, RSS, websites, and other non-personal material may be fetched or processed using external services.

The research plane receives the minimum personal context required to do its job. Prefer generic research requests over uploading rich private profiles.

Example:

Good:
> Find the most material AI developments from the last 24 hours.

Avoid by default:
> Here is the user's full private behavioural history; decide what they like.

## Connectors

Connectors translate provider-specific data into canonical internal forms.

Expected connector families:
- calendar;
- tasks;
- weather;
- RSS/news;
- newsletter/email;
- X/social;
- Reddit/Hacker News;
- external AI briefings;
- print;
- digital delivery.

Providers are replaceable. Canonical models must not expose provider-specific assumptions upstream.

## User model

The user model is a first-class local component, independent of any LLM provider.

It may include:
- explicit interests;
- durable topic affinities;
- preferred languages and language-learning intent;
- reading-density preferences;
- source affinities;
- negative preferences;
- recent-topic fatigue;
- lightweight privacy-preserving feedback.

The model must be inspectable and deletable.

## Editorial engine

The editorial engine:
1. builds a candidate pool;
2. deduplicates and clusters;
3. verifies important factual claims;
4. scores candidates;
5. protects required practical content and serendipity;
6. decides what to cut;
7. emits a canonical publication model.

The renderer never performs editorial reasoning.

## Canonical publication model

The canonical edition should be representable as Markdown plus structured metadata.

Why:
- durable;
- human-readable;
- RAG/search friendly;
- easy to archive in Obsidian-like systems;
- provider/tool independent;
- convertible to HTML/PDF/e-reader formats.

Rendered HTML/PDF are derived products.

## Renderer and validator

Rendering should be deterministic.

Suggested initial stack:
- Python;
- Pydantic schemas;
- Jinja2 templates;
- CSS paged media;
- WeasyPrint for PDF;
- PDF/layout validation;
- CUPS/`lp` print adapter.

The validator enforces:
- DIN A4 geometry;
- page count;
- overflow;
- minimum readable typography;
- required blocks;
- link/QR integrity where practical.

If validation fails, the editorial cut policy runs and rendering repeats.

## Print subsystem

The print adapter should:
- enumerate configured printer capabilities where possible;
- distinguish duplex-capable vs single-sided hardware;
- support Wi-Fi/network CUPS where reliable;
- preserve USB as a viable local fallback;
- surface printer offline / paper / job errors when the platform exposes them.

Do not assume printers can reliably infer paper stock or paper colour. Use named paper profiles instead.

## Delivery decision

A delivery-policy component decides among:
- print;
- email;
- later messaging;
- combinations.

Inputs may include:
- configured print location;
- travel/home state;
- printer availability;
- user pause state;
- explicit schedule overrides.

## Secrets

Secrets must never be committed.

Use:
- OS keychain/keyring where available;
- environment variables for development;
- local encrypted secret stores where appropriate.

## Deployment modes

### Local
Personal plane and publication pipeline run on the user's machine/home server.

### Self-hosted cloud
The user runs Kuşluk in their own infrastructure.

### Managed cloud (future)
Kuşluk operates infrastructure that processes user data. This is explicitly not equivalent to local-first mode and requires separate privacy, security, retention, and regulatory design.

## Observability

Default observability is local:
- structured logs;
- typed failures;
- generation timings;
- connector health;
- print job status.

No remote behavioural telemetry by default.
